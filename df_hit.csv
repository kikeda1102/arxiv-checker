Constraining the Barbero-Immirzi parameter from the duration of inflation in Loop Quantum Cosmology,2022-06-29 19:47:39+00:00,"[arxiv.Result.Author('L. N. Barboza'), arxiv.Result.Author('G. L. L. W. Levy'), arxiv.Result.Author('L. L. Graef'), arxiv.Result.Author('Rudnei O. Ramos')]","We revisit the predictions for the duration of the inflationary phase after
the bounce in Loop Quantum Cosmology. We present our analysis for different
classes of inflationary potentials that include the monomial power-law chaotic
type of potentials, the Starobinsky and the Higgs-like symmetry breaking
potential with different values for the vacuum expectation value. Our set up
can easily be extended to other forms of primordial potentials than the ones we
have considered. Independently on the details of the contracting phase, if the
dynamics starts sufficiently in the far past, the kinetic energy will come to
dominate at the bounce, uniquely determining the amplitude of the inflaton at
this moment. This will be the initial condition for the further evolution that
will provide us with results for the number of {\it e}-folds from the bounce to
the beginning of the accelerated inflationary regime and the subsequent
duration of inflation. We also discuss under which conditions each model
considered could lead to observable signatures on the spectrum of the Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB), or, else, be excluded for not predicting a
sufficient amount of accelerated expansion. A first analysis is performed
considering the standard value for the Barbero-Immirzi parameter, $\gamma
\simeq 0.2375$, which is obtained from black hole entropy calculations. In a
second analysis, we consider the possibility of varying the value of this
parameter, which is motivated by the fact that the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
can be considered a free parameter of the underlying quantum theory in the
context of Loop Quantum Gravity. {}From this analysis, we obtain a lower limit
for this parameter by requiring the minimum amount of inflationary expansion
that makes the model consistent with the CMB observations.",True
