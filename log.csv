open-string vertex algebra $V$. We show that the extensions satisfying some
technical but natural convergence conditions are in bijective correspondence to
the first cohomology classes associated to the $V$-bimodule $\mathcal{H}_N(W_1,
W_2)$ constructed in \cite{HQ-Red}. When $V$ is a grading-restricted vertex
algebra containing a nice vertex subalgebra $V_0$, those convergence conditions
hold automatically. In addition, we show that $\text{Ext}^1(W_1, W_2)$ is
finite dimensional, with its dimension bounded above by the fusion rule
$N\binom{W_2}{VW_1}$ of $V_0$-modules. When $V$ is the Virasoro VOA that does
not contain any nice subalgebras, we also give an example of an abelian
category consisting of certain modules where the convergence conditions hold
for every object.",True,

relation $E(\vec{k}) \sim |\vec{k}|^{\alpha}$, where $\alpha \; (<1)$ is a
noninteger number, in contrast to the situation in conventional Dirac materials
with $\alpha=1$. Here we compute the effects of both short-range and long-range
repulsive Coulomb interactions in two- and three-dimensional FDMs. Generic but
sufficiently weak short-range interaction is an irrelevant perturbation in
$d$-dimensional FDMs, and nucleation of a correlated insulator takes place
through a quantum critical point. The universality class of the associated
quantum phase transition is determined by the correlation length exponent
$\nu^{-1}=d-\alpha$ and dynamic scaling exponent $z=\alpha$, starkly distinct
from its counterpart in conventional Dirac systems. On the other hand, the
fractional dispersion is protected against long-range interaction due to its
nonanalytic structure. Rather a linear Dirac dispersion gets generated under
coarse graining and the associated Fermi velocity increases logarithmically in
the infrared regime. Altogether, the family of correlated FDMs unfolds a new
landscape, accommodating unconventional emergent many-body phenomena.",True

Muñoz'), arxiv.Result.Author('Georges Obied')]","We use Swampland principles to theoretically disfavor regions of the
parameter space of dark matter and other darkly charged particles that may
exist. The Festina Lente bound, the analogue of the Weak-Gravity conjecture in
de Sitter, places constraints on the mass and charge of dark particles, which
here we show cover regions in parameter space that are currently allowed by
observations. As a consequence, a broad set of new ultra-light particles are in
the Swampland, independently of their cosmic abundance, showing the
complementarity of Quantum Gravity limits with laboratory and astrophysical
studies. In parallel, a Swampland bound on the UV cutoff associated to the
axion giving a St\""{u}ckelberg photon its longitudinal mode translates to a new
constraint on the kinetic mixings and masses of dark photons. This covers part
of the parameter space targeted by upcoming dark-photon direct-detection
experiments. Moreover, it puts astrophysically interesting models in the
Swampland, including freeze-in dark matter through an ultra-light dark photon,
as well as radio models invoked to explain the 21-cm EDGES anomaly.",True

wherein the integration-by-parts relations form a left ideal. We describe in
detail the one-loop massless box as an example where we achieved the full
reduction to master integrals by means of the Gr\""obner basis approach, and
report on the performance of the implementation. We also identify potential

Kaiser')]","For decades, physicists have analyzed various versions of a ``cosmic no-hair""
conjecture, to understand under what conditions a spacetime that is initially
spatially anisotropic and/or inhomogeneous will flow into an isotropic and
homogeneous state. Wald's theorem, in particular, established that homogeneous
but anisotropic spacetimes, if filled with a positive cosmological constant
plus additional matter sources that satisfy specific energy conditions, will
necessarily flow toward an (isotropic) de Sitter state at late times. In this
paper we study the flow of homogeneous but anisotropic spacetimes toward
isotropic states under conditions more general than those to which Wald's
theorem applies. We construct an effective field theory (EFT) treatment for
generic ``single-clock"" systems in anisotropic spacetimes -- which are not
limited to realizations compatible with scalar-field constructions -- and
identify fixed points in the resulting phase space. We identify regions of this
phase space that flow to isotropic fixed points -- including a de Sitter fixed
point -- even in the absence of a bare cosmological constant, and for matter
sources that do not obey the energy conditions required for Wald's theorem.
Such flows into de Sitter reveal the emergence of an effective cosmological
constant.",True
