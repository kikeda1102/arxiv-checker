open-string vertex algebra $V$. We show that the extensions satisfying some
technical but natural convergence conditions are in bijective correspondence to
the first cohomology classes associated to the $V$-bimodule $\mathcal{H}_N(W_1,
W_2)$ constructed in \cite{HQ-Red}. When $V$ is a grading-restricted vertex
algebra containing a nice vertex subalgebra $V_0$, those convergence conditions
hold automatically. In addition, we show that $\text{Ext}^1(W_1, W_2)$ is
finite dimensional, with its dimension bounded above by the fusion rule
$N\binom{W_2}{VW_1}$ of $V_0$-modules. When $V$ is the Virasoro VOA that does
not contain any nice subalgebras, we also give an example of an abelian
category consisting of certain modules where the convergence conditions hold
for every object.",True
